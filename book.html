                <h1 class="novel" style="color: #DA0C81; text-align: center;">Born A Crime By Trevor Noah</h1><br>
                <h3 class="prg">Trevor Noah's e-book "Born a Crime" shares his stories of growing up in South Africa underneath apartheid,<br> a time when legal guidelines separated humans by means of race. In the primary  chapters, he talks about<br> being born to a black mother and a white father, which turned into a criminal offense. This a part of his story <br>shows how difficult it became to stay with policies that did not make sense and have been unfair.</h3><br>
                <h3 class="prg">In Mombasa County, people also face problems because of differences in culture and ethnicity. This can lead <br>to misunderstandings and tension among different groups. Trevor's story can inspire those in Mombasa, showing <br>that despite difficulties, you can still hope for a better future. Just like Trevor's mother worked hard to give him a <br>better life, many parents in Mombasa do the same for their children, hoping they will live in a more accepting society.</h3><br>
                <h3 class="prg">Trevor uses humor and stories to deal with the challenges he faced, which is a powerful way to handle tough situations. <br>This approach could help people in Mombasa find common ground and understand each other better, despite their <br>differences. The book is not just about Trevor's own life; it also encourages people everywhere to fight against unfair <br>treatment and to strive for a community where everyone is respected and valued.</h3>
